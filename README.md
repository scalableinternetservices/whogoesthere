This project was an attempt to experiment with different scaling techniques. Initially, we implemented a client-server application insipired by [Doodle](https://doodle.com/en/) and consequently, we experiemented with the following techniques to maximally scale the application:

  - Vertical Scaling
  - Horizontal Scaling
  - Database Indexing and schema optimization
  - Application Optimization
  - Request Compression/Optimization
